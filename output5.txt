What Is Amazon EC2?
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic.

Features of Amazon EC2
Amazon EC2 provides the following features:
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
 <p>Virtual computing environments, known as <em>instances</em></p> </li>
 <p>Preconfigured templates for your instances, known as <em>Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)</em>, that package the bits you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software) </p> </li>
 <p>Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity for your instances, known as <em>instance types</em></p> </li>
 <p>Secure login information for your instances using <em>key pairs</em> (AWS stores the public key, and you store the private key in a secure place) </p> </li>
 <p>Storage volumes for temporary data that&apos;s deleted when you stop or terminate your instance, known as <em>instance store volumes</em></p> </li>
 <p>Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS), known as <em>Amazon EBS volumes</em></p> </li>
 <p>Multiple physical locations for your resources, such as instances and Amazon EBS volumes, known as <em>regions</em> and <em>Availability Zones</em></p> </li>
 <p>A firewall that enables you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances using <em>security groups</em></p> </li>
 <p>Static IPv4 addresses for dynamic cloud computing, known as <em>Elastic IP addresses</em></p> </li>
 <p>Metadata, known as <em>tags</em>, that you can create and assign to your Amazon EC2 resources </p> </li>
 <p>Virtual networks you can create that are logically isolated from the rest of the AWS cloud, and that you can optionally connect to your own network, known as <em>virtual private clouds</em> (VPCs) </p> </li> </ul>

Related Services
You can provision Amazon EC2 resources, such as instances and volumes, directly using Amazon EC2. You can also provision Amazon EC2 resources using other services in AWS. For more information, see the following documentation:

Accessing Amazon EC2
Amazon EC2 provides a web-based user interface, the Amazon EC2 console. If you&apos;ve signed up for an AWS account, you can access the Amazon EC2 console by signing into the AWS Management Console and selecting <b>EC2</b> from the console home page.
If you prefer to use a command line interface, you have the following options:
<dl>
<b><span class="term">AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)</span></b></dt>
 <p>Provides commands for a broad set of AWS products, and is supported on Windows, Mac, and Linux. To get started, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/">AWS Command Line Interface User Guide</a>. For more information about the commands for Amazon EC2, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/index.html">ec2</a> in the <em>AWS CLI Command Reference</em>. </p> </dd>
<b><span class="term">AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell</span></b></dt>
 <p>Provides commands for a broad set of AWS products for those who script in the PowerShell environment. To get started, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/">AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell User Guide</a>. For more information about the cmdlets for Amazon EC2, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/reference/Index.html">AWS Tools for PowerShell Cmdlet Reference</a>. </p> </dd> </dl>
Amazon EC2 provides a Query API. These requests are HTTP or HTTPS requests that use the HTTP verbs GET or POST and a Query parameter named <code class="code">Action</code>. For more information about the API actions for Amazon EC2, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/query-apis.html">Actions</a> in the <em>Amazon EC2 API Reference</em>.
If you prefer to build applications using language-specific APIs instead of submitting a request over HTTP or HTTPS, AWS provides libraries, sample code, tutorials, and other resources for software developers. These libraries provide basic functions that automate tasks such as cryptographically signing your requests, retrying requests, and handling error responses, making it is easier for you to get started.
